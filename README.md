## Tools used
- Microsoft Excel for data for data analysis, cleaning and visu-alization[Download Here](https://microsoft.com)
- SQL- Structured query language for Querying of Data[Download Here](https://www.mysql.com)
- Github for Portfolio building [Download Here](https://github.com)
- Power Bi for Data Cleaning and visualization. [Download Here](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/downloads/)


## Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the intial phase, we carried out:
1. Data Loading and Inspection: the sales data was downloaded and uploaded on the Microsoft excel sheet. 
2. Data formatting and cleaning: the data was checked for duplicates and blanks which was cleared using the data tab and removing the blanks option on the find and select tab. 
3. handling missing variables: The revenue was calculated by UNIT PRICE * QUANTITY and then using flashfill to fill the remaining column
- also the AVERAGE REVENUE was caculated using AVERAGEIF function
