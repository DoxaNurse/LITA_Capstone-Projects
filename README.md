- **Product**: The product sold.
- **Region**: The sales region.
- **Order Date**: Date the order was placed.
- **Quantity**: Number of units sold.
- **Unit Price**: Price per unit.
- **Revenue**: Total revenue from the order.
- **Average Revenue**: Average revenue per order

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
In the intial phase, we carried out:
1. **Data Loading and Inspection**: the sales data was downloaded and uploaded on the Microsoft excel sheet. 
2. **Data formatting and cleaning**: the data was checked for duplicates and blanks which was cleared using the data tab and removing the blanks option on the find and select tab. 
3. **handling missing variables**: The revenue was calculated by UNIT PRICE * QUANTITY and then using flashfill to fill the remaining column
- also the AVERAGE REVENUE was caculated using AVERAGEIF function

## Data Summarization with Pivot Table
- **Regional Performance**This table indicates Regional Performance with the Southern Region having more sales of about 928,000.

## Data Visualization with Power Bi
Here, we will be analysing the columns on different visuals which will include sales overview, top-performing products, and regional breakdowns. 
### Sales Overview
this shows a Line chart showing revenue trends over time, with the key indicators being revenue and Order date(Month). We can see the peak month(february) with 0.55M revenue and the lowest month being September with 0.03M. 

![Screenshot (80)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bad8f3c8-2098-4eb6-a4df-c773906cb2ff)

### Top performing Product
A Clustered column chart displaying total revenue by product with shoes generating the highest revenue at O.61M and socks generaring the lowest at 0.18M. 

![Screenshot (81)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/54cbc48a-c508-4d2b-bcfd-5810959e5739)

## Conclusion
The comprehensive analysis of the Capstone sales data within this repository has provided valuable insights into sales overview, product performance, and regional trends. By leveraging SQL queries, visualizations, and detailed analysis, we've been able to:

- Identify the most profitable products and regions.

- Understand the average revenue per product.

- Analyze monthly sales trends to uncover seasonal patterns.

- Highlight the impact of high-value products on overall revenue.

These insights are crucial for strategic decision-making, allowing us to optimize pricing strategies for expensive products which has low revenue generation, tailor marketing efforts into regions where some of the products are not available, and improve inventory management. By continuously refining our approach based on data-driven findings, we can drive significant growth and enhance overall business performance of Capstone.

- **Customer Name**: Name of the customer.
- **Region**: The sales customers
- **Subscription Type**: Type of subscription purchased.
- **Subscription Start**: Start date of the subscription.
- **Subscription End**: End date of the subscription.
- **Cancelled**: Indicates whether the subscription was cancelled.
- **Subscription Duration**: Duration of the subscription in months.

## Skills-
- **SQL**: Proficient in writing complex queries, data manipulation, and database management.
- **Microsoft Excel**: Advanced skills in data analysis, pivot tables, and data summarization
- **Power BI**: Experienced in creating interactive dashboards and reports to visualize data insights.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating insightful charts and dashboards to communicate findings effectively.
- **Data Cleaning**: Expertise in cleaning and preparing data for analysis.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Applying statistical methods to analyze data and draw meaningful conclusions.
  
## Repository structure
- **data/**: Raw data files.
- **scripts/**: SQL queries and data cleaning scripts.
- **visualizations/**: Images and files of the visualizations created.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel for data for data analysis, cleaning and visu-alization[Download Here](https://microsoft.com)
- SQL- Structured query language for Querying of Data[Download Here](https://www.mysql.com)
- Github for Portfolio building [Download Here](https://github.com)

## Data cleaning and Preparation
In the intial phase, we carried out:
1. **Data Loading and Inspection**: the sales data was downloaded and uploaded on the Microsoft excel sheet. 
2. **Data formatting and cleaning**: the data was checked for duplicates and blanks which was cleared using the data tab and removing the blanks option on the find and select tab. 
3. **handling missing variables**: The subscription duration was calculated with the DATEDIFF function and filling the necessary arrays, which returned 12 months and FLASH FILL was applied to get for the other rows.

## Data summarization with Pivot Table
- **Churn rate Analysis**: This pivot table shows the number of customers that cancelled their subscription(TRUE) versus the active customers(FALSE) in which those that did not cancel were more with about 3,000 difference.

![Screenshot (65)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ea956c38-4aa0-4768-bbec-0bafec989c33)

- **Churn rate by Subscription type**: in this table, we analysed each subscription type and the number of cancellation in relation to it. The Premium subscription type has more cancellations(5,064) in relation to its returning customers with little difference in cancellations compared to Standard, while the Basic has more Active customers(11,864).

![Screenshot (106)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0f9f416d-c2d3-412f-ab2d-da52bc9a2506)

- **Subscription type Popularity**: The basic Plan has more customers going for it which the value(16,921) is twice the other subscription types.

  ![Screenshot (66)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9c6a76c8-5fe2-494d-9b02-8f0dc4729e38)

- **Revenue Analysis**: this table highlights each subscription type revenue contribution with the Basic Plan generating the highest at 33,776,735. 

![Screenshot (64)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b008730-a627-4754-958f-88120e66a276)

![Screenshot (68)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abc3b1bc-127e-42ba-8000-0b9ee0ac08cf)

- **Churn Rate by Region**: this table highlights csncellation rates according to region. There are no csncellations in the East at all compared to other region while there are more cancellation in the North.

![Screenshot (68)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8dbf3f83-f72e-429f-b884-72fe25b135c6)

- **Revenue by Region**: this table summarizes the revenue contribution of each region with all the regions summing around the same value but the  East has more revenue return(16,968,763) and the west being the lowest(16,864,376).

## Conclusion-
The customer segmentation service analysis provided invaluable insights into customer behavior, subscription patterns, and regional distribution. By leveraging SQL queries, visualizations, and detailed analysis, we have been able to:

- Identify key customer segments based on subscription types and durations.

- Understand patterns in subscription cancellations and active subscriptions.

- Analyze regional performance to identify high and low-performing areas.

- Examine the average subscription duration and its impact on customer retention.

These insights are critical for making informed decisions that can enhance targeted marketing efforts, improve customer retention strategies, and optimize overall business performance. By continually analyzing customer data, we can adapt to changing trends and ensure sustained growth and customer satisfaction.
